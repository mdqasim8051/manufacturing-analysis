# Manufacturing Process Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes manufacturing production data to evaluate operational efficiency, identify quality issues, monitor machine and employee performance, and reduce production wastage using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI
- Tableau
- MySQL

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed manufacturing operational records including work orders, machines, employees, shifts, production quantities, rejected quantities, processed quantities, delivery timelines, and financial metrics.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized date and time formats
- Validated numeric production and rejection fields
- Created calculated fields and KPIs in Excel and SQL

---

## 🧩 Data Modeling
- Designed structured tables for production, machines, employees, and work orders
- Built relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Used SQL queries to aggregate and validate production metrics

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- Manufactured Quantity
- Processed Quantity
- Rejected Quantity
- Wastage Quantity
- Production Efficiency %
- Machine-wise Rejected Quantity
- Employee-wise Rejected Quantity
- Department-wise Production Performance
- Manufacture vs Rejected Trend

---

## 📈 Dashboards
- Excel dashboard for production and quality KPIs
- Power BI dashboard with interactive filters
- Tableau dashboard for visual performance comparison

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Certain machines contribute disproportionately to rejection rates
- Employee-wise rejection levels vary significantly
- Some departments show higher wastage
- Production efficiency varies across shifts and plants

---

## 🎯 Recommendations
- Perform preventive maintenance on high-rejection machines
- Improve quality checks in critical departments
- Train employees with high rejection trends
- Monitor daily KPIs through dashboards
